For applications requesting greater discretion, please email MoneroFund@magicgrants.org with your submission yet note partial, and eventual full, disclosure of the your work (not your identity) will still occur.

# Candidate Background

Please provide a paragraph or two describing you and/or your team. While you may be pseudonymous with your submission, you will eventually need to fill out the [Due Diligence And Other Legal Checklist](https://magicgrants.org/funds/MAGIC%20Fund%20Grant%20Disbursement%20Process%20and%20Requirements.pdf) in order to be awarded a grant. As part of that process, a sanctions check will be conducted with the mentioned sanctions programs.

# Project Description

Describe your project and what makes it beneficial to Monero.

# Technical Approach

Detail how you plan to accomplish your goals, along with how the grant money will be applied to your work.

# Milestones and Budget

Set firm targets for your work to accomplish and state the amount of funding expected at each step. Each milestone accomplished should be partnered with a report/summary of your completed work. Milestones may not have explicit results, instead allowing for hours of work to be used (which may be especially notable for research grants), yet such milestones are expected to have much more detailed documentation upon their submission accordingly.

Your grant should be voted on for approval within 3 weeks, barring exceptional circumstances. The MAGIC Monero Fund is currently expecting to fund grants up to 20,000 USD at this time.
